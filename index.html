        <h1>what is web development? </h1>
        <p>Web development is the practice of building and maintaining websites and web applications. This includes tasks such as designing and coding websites, creating interactive elements, ensuring websites are user-friendly and responsive, and integrating databases and server-side technologies. Web development can involve front-end development, which focuses on the visual appearance and user experience of a website, as well as back-end development, which involves the server-side logic and functionality that powers the website</p>
